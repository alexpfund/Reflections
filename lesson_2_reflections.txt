What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a directory .git. The reason it does this, is so that it can put data in there to track all of the changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to choose what you will be committing at one time, even if there are other things in your working directory or repository. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have  one commit per logical change?

By only staging the files that include the logical change, and then you can add more commits to with their own explanations.
